    "1. **Term Saturation**: In the TF-IDF model, term frequency (TF) has diminishing returns, meaning that additional occurrences of a term in a document yield diminishing benefits. The BM25 model introduces a saturation function to address this issue.\n",

    "BM25, a ranking function used in information retrieval, is often implemented in search engines or document retrieval systems. When a new document or item is added to the collection, it traditionally requires reindexing to update the BM25 index to accurately reflect the new state of the document collection. This is because BM25 calculations are based on document frequency (DF) values for each term, which change with the addition of new documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, there are strategies to mitigate the need for full reconstruction of the BM25 index:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Incremental Indexing**: Instead of rebuilding the entire index, you can add the new document to the existing index and update the necessary statistics. This method requires careful management of term frequencies and document frequencies to ensure the index remains accurate.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Partitioned Indexes**: By partitioning the index, you can limit updates to a smaller portion of the index where the new document fits. This approach often involves creating a smaller, secondary index for new documents and merging it with the main index at regular intervals.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Deferred Updates**: In this approach, changes are collected over a period and then applied in bulk. This can be efficient if the rate of change is not too high, as it reduces the frequency of reindexing.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Using a Database with Real-time Indexing Capabilities**: Some modern databases and search engines are designed to handle real-time indexing efficiently. They automatically update the index as new data comes in, without requiring a full rebuild.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Near Real-time (NRT) Indexing**: This is a common approach in systems like Elasticsearch, where the index is updated almost in real time. It allows new documents to be searchable very quickly after being added, without the need for a full index rebuild.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Sharding**: In large-scale systems, sharding the index (dividing it into smaller, manageable pieces) can help. When a new document is added, only the relevant shard is updated, which is less resource-intensive than reindexing everything.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these strategies has its own trade-offs in terms of complexity, resource usage, and update latency. The choice depends on the specific requirements of the system, such as the rate of new document additions, the size of the document collection, and the acceptable latency for the documents to be searchable."

    "BEIR, or Benchmarking IR, is a benchmark suite designed for evaluating Information Retrieval (IR) models, particularly in the context of neural retrieval. It's significant because it provides a comprehensive, diverse, and challenging set of datasets for testing the generalizability of these models. Key aspects of BEIR include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Diverse Domains**: BEIR covers a wide range of domains, such as scientific articles, news articles, and general queries. This diversity ensures that models are tested in various scenarios, reflecting real-world applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Heterogeneous Tasks**: The benchmark includes different types of IR tasks like fact-checking, question answering, and citation prediction. This helps in understanding how well models perform across different IR challenges.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Zero-Shot Setting**: BEIR focuses on evaluating models in a zero-shot setting, where models are tested on datasets they were not trained on. This tests the model's ability to generalize to new data.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Comprehensive Evaluation Metrics**: BEIR employs standard IR metrics like Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (nDCG), Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR), and Precision@k. These metrics give a well-rounded assessment of model performance.\n",
